                <Project title="Browser Game Engine" src="/media/gifs/game-engine.gif">
                    <Text>Inspired by browser games I enjoyed as a kid, I was determined to create my own browser game engine from sctatch. I spent over a year creating and re-iterating a complex game engine complete with spritesheets, sprite animations, collision detection, state tracking, and more!</Text>
                    <Text>Besides <Text fontWeight="B">TypeScript</Text>, no external libraries were used in the development of this game engine. This project was a huge learning experience for me, both in complex system design and in general computer science principles. I learned various technologies and methods, including binary trees, quadtrees, web graphics, rendering, culling, and more. Most importantly, I learned the importance of <Text fontWeight="B">modular programming</Text> in developing complex systems from the bottom up.</Text>
                </Project>
                <Project title="Twitch Paints" src="/media/images/twitch-paints.png">
                    <Text>Inspired by the infamous "Twitch Plays Pok√©mon", I set out to create a live stream where viewers could draw together!</Text>
                    <Text>To make this idea a reality, I established a <Text fontWeight="B">WebSocket</Text> connection to my Twitch Chat and parsed messages (using <Text fontWeight="B">Regex</Text>) sent by viewers for structured commands. These commands would include a coordinate pair for a cell and a hex color code to paint that cell.</Text>

                    <Text>I am always working on something new! Here are a few more screenshots from React projects that showcase my frontend skills:</Text>

                <Heading>My Journey</Heading>
                <Text>Since the age of 12, I have always had interest in tech and programming. Inspired by MMOs such as Club Penguin and Poptropica, I taught myself web development in hopes of someday creating my own browser games.</Text>
                <Text>In high school, I joined my school's robotics team as a software engineer and would work on competition-ready robots. After a year, I was a lead software engineer and was responsible for teaching newcomers how to code as well as communicating with other leads in other departments. Through robotics, I learned the importance of <Text fontWeight="B">inter-team communication</Text>, setting and following through on <Text fontWeight="B">deadlines</Text>, and other important skillsets valuable to working on a <Text fontWeight="B">team</Text>.</Text>
                <Text>After high school, I studied <Text fontWeight="B">Cybersecurity</Text> at the <Text fontWeight="B">University of South Florida</Text>. During this time, I learned a lot about networking and databases and I brushed up on my knowledge of languages such as <Text fontWeight="B">Java</Text> and <Text fontWeight="B">Python</Text>.</Text>
                <Text>Through USF, I landed an internship at <Text fontWeight="B">ReliaQuest</Text>, a cybersecurity firm based in Tampa, Florida. Here I worked on a team responsible for triaging and resolving bug reports. In addition to squishing bugs, I also developed software for internal use to automate various processes used by my team. This internship was very fruitful and further ingrained the importance of <Text fontWeight="B">cross-team collaboration</Text> as I worked with the design team to help create reusable patterns.</Text>
                <Text>Now, after years of freelance work, I am looking to join a company that shares my <Text fontWeight="B">passion</Text> and <Text fontWeight="B">commitment</Text> for creating <Text fontWeight="B">quality</Text> software.</Text>
